      <header>What is JavaScript?</header>
      <p>JavaScript is one of the most widely used and popular programming languages in the world. It was born in 1995
        to
        add interactivity to web pages and has since evolved into a general-purpose programming language. In other
        words:
        it can be used for almost anything.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What is programming? It's the act of constructing a program or set of instructions to tell a computer what
          and
          how we want it to do something. It's no different from when we "program" a washing machine, only instead of
          pressing a button, we are going to use text. This text is known as "code."</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Browser_Console">
      <header>Browser Console</header>
      <p>To follow the course and test what you're doing, you'll need a web browser for now. You probably already have
        one
        installed; if not, I recommend installing Google Chrome or Brave Browser. All browsers have a tool called a
        console. The console allows us to execute JavaScript code in real-time and see the result. We can also see
        errors,
        warnings, and traces produced in our code. Although we can execute JavaScript code in other ways, to start,
        we're
        going to use this tool provided by the browser.</p>
      <p>To open the browser console, do the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open your favorite web browser, for example, Google Chrome.</li>
        <li>Go to the about:blank page in the address bar. This way, the web page we've loaded won't bother us.</li>
        <li>Right-click anywhere on the page and select the Inspect Element or Inspect option.</li>
        <li>Click on Console.</li>
        <li>You can now enter your JavaScript code.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
      <header>Data Types</header>
      <p>In JavaScript, like any other programming language, we're going to want to translate real-world information
        into
        our code. To do this, we need to understand what data types exist in the language to represent the information
        we
        need. In JavaScript, we have 9 data types that are divided into two large groups: primitive or non-primitive.
        I'll
        explain what this means later, but for now, let's look at the primitive types.</p>
      <p>Among the primitive types, we have 7 data types: <strong><i>number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol,
            bigint</i></strong></p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Comparison_Operators">
      <header>Comparison Operators</header>
      <p>Comparison operators in JavaScript allow us to compare two values. They always return a boolean value (true or
        false). For example, we can compare if one number is greater than another with the > operator, or if one number
        is
        less than another with the &lt; operator.</p>
      <code>
          5 > 3 // true<br>
          5 &lt; 3 // false
        </code>
      <p>We also have the >= and &lt;= operators that allow us to compare if a number is greater than or equal to
        another,
        or if a number is less than or equal to another.</p>
      <code>
          5 >= 3 // true<br>
          5 >= 5 // true<br>
          5 &lt;= 3 // false<br>
          5 &lt;= 5 // true<br>
        </code>
      <p>To check if two values are equal, we can use the === operator or, to see if they are different, the !==
        operator.</p>
      <code>
          5 === 5 // true<br>
          5 !== 5 // false<br>
        </code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Logical_Operators">
      <header>Logical Operators</header>
      <p>Logical operators in JavaScript (and in many other programming languages) are used to evaluate logical
        expressions. In JavaScript, there are three logical operators: AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).</p>
      <p>Logical AND operator &&: The logical AND operator is denoted by &&. It returns true when both values it
        connects
        are true.</p>
      <code>
          true && true // → true<br>
          true && false // → false<br>
          false && false // → false<br>
        </code>
      <p>Logical OR operator ||: The logical OR operator is denoted by || and returns true when either of the values it
        connects is true.</p>
      <code>
          true || true // → true<br>
          true || false // → true<br>
          false || false // → false<br>
        </code>
      <p>Logical NOT operator !: The logical NOT operator is denoted by ! and inverts the value of a boolean. It is
        placed
        in front of the value we want to invert.</p>
      <code>
          !true // → false<br>
          !false // → true<br>
        </code>
      <p>Combining logical, arithmetic, and comparison operators: Logical operators and comparison operators can be
        combined to create more complex expressions. For example, we can ask if a number is between two values.</p>
      <code>
          2 &lt; 3 && 3 &lt; 4 // → true
        </code>
      <p>You can also use parentheses to group operations and use logical and arithmetic operators.</p>
      <code>
          (2 + 2) &lt; 3 && (10 &lt; (8 * 2)) // → false
        </code>
      <p>Likewise, it's important to know that arithmetic operations take precedence over comparison operations.</p>
      <code>
          2 + 2 &lt; 3 && 10 &lt; 8 * 2<br>
          // First, arithmetic operations are performed:<br>
          // → 4 &lt; 3 && 10 &lt; 16<br>
          // Now the comparisons:<br>
          // → false && true<br>
          // Finally:<br>
          // → false<br>
        </code>
